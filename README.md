# Secure Todo App

A secure and modern full-stack Todo application built with React, TailwindCSS, Express.js, SQLite, and Sequelize ORM. Features user authentication with JWT and password hashing via bcrypt. Designed for security, performance, and a clean developer experience.

## Features

- ‚úÖ JWT-based Authentication
- üîê Password hashing with bcrypt
- üìã CRUD for Todos
- üì¶ SQLite database via Sequelize ORM
- üé® TailwindCSS for UI styling
- ‚öõÔ∏è React Frontend
- ‚öôÔ∏è Express.js Backend
- üß™ Secure and scalable folder structure
- real-time communication using socket.io

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React
- TailwindCSS
- socket.io-client

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize ORM
- SQLite
- JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- bcryptjs
- socket.io

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm

## Introduction to Socket.IO

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that makes real-time, bidirectional communication between browsers (or other clients) and a Node.js server easy. It gives you event-based sockets with lots of useful features (auto reconnect, rooms, namespaces, fallbacks) so you can build chat apps, live dashboards, multiplayer games, notifications, collaborative editors, etc.

## What Socket.IO is

- A client + server library for realtime messaging (JS on both browser and Node).
- Wraps a protocol on top of WebSocket and HTTP long-polling ‚Äî exposing a nice event-based API: `socket.emit('myEvent', data)` and `socket.on('myEvent', handler)`.
- Adds features **WebSocket alone does not** provide out of the box: automatic reconnection, heartbeats, acknowledgement callbacks, rooms, namespaces, and a small framing/protocol layer.

### Key takeaways

- Socket.IO = event-driven realtime library (client + server).
- Adds reliability & higher-level features beyond raw WebSockets.
